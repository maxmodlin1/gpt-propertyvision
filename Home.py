**Prompt for 'gpt4-vision' to Generate Real Estate Property Description:**

Dear gpt4-vision,

I am requesting you to analyze the set of images I have provided and craft a detailed UK real estate listing. Each set includes pictures of the property's exterior, interior, and any notable features or amenities. Please scrutinize all visual aspects to ensure the description is accurate and comprehensive. Follow the structure outlined below to maintain consistency and professionalism across all listings but don't call out each section explicitly.

**Required Structure for the Property Description:**

   1. Generate a captivating title that should include the property type, one standout feature, and the location but dont call out the word Title.
   2. Begin with an inviting opening that summarizes the property's appeal and its most enticing attributes.
   3. Describe the architectural style, landscaping, lot size, and any outdoor features such as pools, gardens, garages, or patios.
   4. Detail the layout, flooring types, natural light, room functions, and any high-end finishes or appliances.
